      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color predominantly for all key textual elements including headings, navigation links, and call-to-action text to establish a strong brand presence. The 'background' color should remain white to maintain clarity and contrast. The 'secondary' color serves as a vibrant accent background for important sections or highlights, with text in 'secondaryForeground' to ensure readability and visual harmony. This limited palette ensures high contrast and accessibility while supporting a bold and creative aesthetic. Avoid diluting the palette with additional colors to maintain brand consistency and impact.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' color on 'background' white provides excellent contrast exceeding WCAG AA standards for text and UI elements. The 'secondary' yellow background with 'secondaryForeground' burnt orange text also meets WCAG AA contrast requirements for large text, ensuring accessibility for highlighted sections. This palette supports clear readability and visual hierarchy across the site."
